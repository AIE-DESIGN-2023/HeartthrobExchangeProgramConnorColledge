  gardensDialoguePromptText:
  - '"I bet this is a great place to run!"'
  gardenPlayerResponse:
  - That sounds like fun! Let's do it now!
  - Running makes me tired.
  - Don't you realize that would ruin the ambience?

  gardenDateReaction:
  - '"Oh! Well, I didn''t bring my running clothes, but I love the enthusiasm! Perhaps
    another time..."" '
  - '"Sounds like somebody needs to go running more often!"'
  - '"I didn''t say I was gonna do it... Just that it would be nice."'
  barDialoguePromptText:
  - '"Could you order me a diet lemonade, please?"'
  barPlayerResponse:
  - Wise choice, you gotta watch out for sugar.
  - Not a big alcohol fan?
  - You should get a proper drink, like an adult would.
  barResponseAffinity: 0f00000005000000ecffffff
  barDateReaction:
  - '"Absolutely, sugar is the first thing I cut out when I started training."'
  - '"I just don''t like the way alcohol makes me feel, y''know?"'
  - '"I fail to see how inebriating one''s self makes them more adult-like..."'
  arcadeDialoguePromptText:
  - '"I''ve never really tried videogames before"'
  arcadePlayerResponse:
  - I like to think of videogames as their own kind of sport.
  - Would you like to do something else?
  - I guess videogames aren't for people like you
  arcadeResponseAffinity: 0f00000005000000ecffffff
  arcadeDateReaction:
  - '"Oh really? We''d better get training then!"'
  - '"No, no! I was excited to see what all the fuss was about!"'
  - '"Why don''t you let me be the judge of that, okay?"'
  aquariumDialoguePromptText:
  - '"What''s the biggest fish you think you could take in a fight?"'
  aquariumPlayerResponse:
  - Shark. No contest.
  - Oh, I don't know... Maybe a dolphin?
  - Why would anyone wanna hurt a living creature like that?
  aquariumResponseAffinity: 0f00000005000000ecffffff
  aquariumDateReaction:
  - '"Pffft, you''re such a dweeb! You''d be shredded in seconds!"'
  - '"Dolphin''s are jerks. ''bout time someone took them down a peg!"'
  - '"Jeez, it''s just a hypothetical..."'
