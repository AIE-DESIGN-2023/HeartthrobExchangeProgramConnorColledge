    I appreciate your kind words anyway""'

    Feel free to order something for yourself."'

  - '"Not at the time, but thinking back I would''ve appreciated the oppurtunity
    to make up my own mind about it.""'
  - '"I''m actually rather intrigued, if you don''t mind showing me around, that
    is?"'
  - '"I was warned there''d be violence..."'

  - Did you know that dolphins are actually mammals?
  aquariumResponseAffinity: 0f00000005000000ecffffff
  aquariumDateReaction:
  - '"One can only wonder what dolphins really think of us..."'
  - '"What an amusing anecdote! Looking at them, I guess the size and sharpness is
    just a little unsettling..."'
  - '"Do you think me some kind of dullard?"'
